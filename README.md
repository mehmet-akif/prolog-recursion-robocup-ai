# prolog-recursion-robocup-ai

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Prolog programs** showcasing the use of **logic programming** for solving AI-related problems.  
The projects explore **list operations, recursion, nested search, custom data structures, RoboCup soccer simulation, and tree traversal**.  

The main goals of these projects are to demonstrate how Prolog can be used to:  
- Represent knowledge in facts and rules.  
- Perform reasoning through recursive definitions.  
- Implement symbolic problem-solving strategies.  
- Explore AI-inspired simulations such as RoboCup passing and scoring.  
  R = [false, true, false, true, false].
